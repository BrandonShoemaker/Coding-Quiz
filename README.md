# All purpose quiz

## description

### Introduction

The purpose of this project was to build a quiz of some sort that had a timer, scoreboard with local storage and functioning questions with answers

### Troubles

The main problem that was encountered with this oarticular program was partway between two issues:

1.) I was having trouble finding a suitable situation to use objects for scalability. 

2.) My state of mind, I encountered a sort of burnout that caused me to have a very foggy  mind leading to a very unproductive workflow and some poor
    design choices that didnt support scalability too well. All of the code that needs to be scalable is such.

### Future plans

I plan to come back to this page after learning more core concepts of web development and more tricks as well as experience. 

Most of the plans include a redesigned layout straying from the provided mockup, js cleanup, optimization, and if necessary refactoring. 

More specifically, I would like to upload scores to a database for true storage rather than local and rewrite all of the js.
